This project aims to: 
> classify algae based on species. currently has six species that it can classify.
> show prevention mechanisms for each type of algae
> use factors to determine the likelihood of algal bloom occurring. These factors are temperature, pH, salinity (in PSU), and minterals present.


The training dataset for six algal species can be found within this google drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1C68lihOA9PR8XbXrRehVIPyWGWDo5w4C?usp=sharing
